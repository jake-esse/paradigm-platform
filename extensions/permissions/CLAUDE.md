# Permission System - AI Context

## Purpose
Control which apps can access user data, for how long, and what they can do with it.

## Key Concepts
- Users own all their data
- Apps must request permission to access data
- Users can revoke permissions anytime
- Permissions can have time limits

## Database Tables
- apps: Registered applications
- data_permissions: Who gave which app access to what
- user_data: Actual user data storage

## Next Features to Build
1. Permission request API
2. Permission grant/deny API
3. Check permission API
4. Revoke permission API
