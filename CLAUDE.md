# Paradigm Platform - AI Context

## What We're Building
Paradigm is a platform where users own their data and earn equity in apps they use.
Like an app store, but users keep their data and get shares in successful apps.

## Current Status
- Day 2 of development
- Supabase installed and running locally
- Starting KYC integration next

## Architecture
- Using Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- Extending Supabase with KYC verification
- Building SDK for app developers

## Next Steps
1. Set up KYC integration with auth hooks
2. Create permission system for data sharing
3. Build developer SDK

## Important Notes
- US-only launch (requires KYC)
- Users can earn max $2,200/year in equity (Reg CF limit)
- Apps pay 20% revenue share to platform
